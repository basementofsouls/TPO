Save your pity for the weak
Let go, no more excuses
Let go of the life you've known
Listen to your intuition
Don't let fear control
Let go of the life you've known
Don't let fear control
I won't live at the bottoms anymore, anymore, anymore
Destroy the weakness
To be on top of the world
Extermination
Taking over the world
So let me tell you
You can't break what you didn't build
You don't own anything to steal
Face your fears and reap the reward
Nothing in life worth having comes easy
So let go of the life you've known
Don't let fear control
Destroy the weakness
To be on top of the world
Extermination
Taking over the world
I won't live at the bottom anymore, anymore, anymore
So save your pity for the weak
